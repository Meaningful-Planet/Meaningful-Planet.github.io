Eurasian beavers, with their distinctive orange teeth and flat tails, are more than just cute; they're nature's engineers. By creating dams, ponds, and canals, beavers play a crucial role in shaping ecosystems, benefiting a wide range of wildlife from water beetles to birds, bats, frogs, and fish. This project at the Nene Wetlands nature reserve isn't just about bringing back a species - it's about restoring entire wetland habitats and the biodiversity they support.",
