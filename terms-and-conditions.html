The Services may also include access to any Premium Services, provided you have requested access to these services and we or our Service Provider or Network Provider approve their usage. As part of the Premium Services you may also access Age Restricted Services, provided you are eighteen (18) or over and you do not show or send any content from the Age Restricted Services to anyone under eighteen (18) years old. <br>‍<br>4.3 As part of the Services you may be able to upload and send your own content. To be able to take advantage of this functionality you grant to Meaningful Planet, our Service Provider and our Network Provider a royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable and worldwide licence to store, transmit or otherwise deal with any content you upload using the Services. <br>‍<br>4.4 In relation to the provision of the Service, Meaningful Planet:(a) may change or withdraw some, or part, of the Services from time to time; and (b) may determine or change how Services are presented and delivered to the Handset or are otherwise made available to you at any time. This may be for a range of reasons including because of changing technologies, obsolescence, new or different product features, changing content providers or the need to remove, replace or modify content. Subject to Section 7.3, you are entitled to end your relationship with Meaningful Planet where any such variation is likely to be of material detriment to you. <br><br><strong>Telephone Numbers</strong><br><br>4.5 As part of the Services you will be provided with a telephone number associated with your SIM card. You agree that:(a) you have no rights to, and do not own, the telephone number that Meaningful Planet (or its Service Provider or Network Provider) provides to you;<br>(b) the telephone number provided to you is subject to a range of regulatory requirements and numbering rules and that you shall comply with such requirements as set out in the Contract or where otherwise notified to you by Meaningful Planet or its Service Provider or Network Provider; and<br>(c) you will not transfer or attempt to transfer your telephone number to any third party (except on termination of the Contract in circumstances where you have requested a PAC before termination).<br>‍<br>4.6 In exceptional circumstances Meaningful Planet may need to change your telephone number provided as part of the Services, including where a government authority may order the reallocation or change of telephone numbers. Meaningful Planet will use commercially reasonable endeavours to notify you by e-mail or letter of any changes to your telephone number, including the date on which such changes shall commence.<br>‍<br>4.7 Where Meaningful Planet is required to change the telephone number, such a change shall be considered to be of material detriment to you and shall entitle you to terminate your use of the services in accordance with Section 13.3. <br>‍<br>4.8 Meaningful Planet shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may arise as a result of Meaningful Planet changing your telephone number.<br>Moving / Transferring Your Telephone Number <br><br>4.9 We can help you move / transfer your current mobile number to your new Plan.

The PAC will be valid for a period of thirty (30) days. If you do not use your PAC within that timeframe it will stop working, and you will need to request a new PAC if you still wish to transfer / port your number.<br> <br>4.12 We will endeavour to switch your old number over to your new Plan in one (1) working day. <br><br><br><strong>SMS Services<br><br>‍</strong>4.13 Each SMS is limited to 160 characters. If your message is longer than 160 characters then it will be broken down into the required number of SMS messages necessary to send your message in full and you will be charged for each SMS message sent. Where you send SMS messages to multiple recipients you will be charged for the SMS messages sent to each recipient. If we cannot send your SMS message we will continue trying for such time as our Network Provider and Service Provider allow, but you should not expect that to continue for more than 24 hours.

However, the Services will only be made available within our coverage area (which comprises a video service area and a voice &amp; picture area within the UK). Within this area, there may be areas where you do not have access to all or some of the Services or where coverage is otherwise limited or unavailable due to the manner in which the Services are provided and the limitations set out in Section 4.18 below. <br>‍<br>4.16 It may also not be possible to use the Services outside of the UK.

For example, it may implement procedures to slow down P2P file-sharing and tethering activities during peak times and to optimise video streaming. We are not involved in and do not have any control over how our Network Provider or Service Provider measures or shapes the traffic that passes over its network. Please check our Network Provider or Service Provider traffic management policies for more information on how traffic is managed and how this may impact on the Services provided to you.<br>‍<br>4.18 There may be situations when the Services are not continuously available or the quality of the Services is affected.

For instance the Services may be affected or become unavailable: (a) when we, our Service Provider or our Network Provider need to perform upgrading, maintenance or other work on the network or Services or improve, modify, test, maintain or repair their network or services;<br> (b) when you move outside the video service area whilst you are on a call (in this case calls may not be maintained);<br> (c) when you are in areas not covered by our Network Provider's network. In these cases Services may rely on other operators' networks over which we have no control;<br> (d) because of other factors that may be outside our control, including the features or functionality of your Handset, any regulatory requirements, lack of capacity, interruptions to services, failures or delays caused by or from other third party suppliers and our Network Provider, faults in other communication networks, the weather, radio interference caused by hills, tunnels or other physical obstructions, acts of God, industrial action, war, terrorism, any governmental action or any decision made by a competent court; or(e) due to fraudulent, illegal or abusive usage of the Services for which Meaningful Planet or our Network Provider or Service Provider may need to take preventive action.<br><br><strong>Suspension of the Service</strong><br><br>4.19 You agree that Meaningful Planet may Suspend any or all of the Services you use without notice if:(a) we reasonably believe you have provided us with false or misleading details about yourself or we reasonably believe that you have used the Services, the SIM(s) or a telephone number for illegal or improper purposes in contravention of Meaningful Planet's Acceptable Use Policy;<br> (b) we reasonably believe that you have been using the Services fraudulently or for the purposes of committing any form of fraud or for any analogous or similar activity;<br> (c) you have breached any term of the Contract (including where you have failed to pay any amounts and/or Charges due);<br> (d) you inform us that your Handset or SIM have been lost or stolen;<br> (e) you do anything (or allow anything to be done) which we think may harm or damage or affect the mobile network of the Network Provider, the infrastructure of the Service Provider or the Services or their operation;<br> (f) we receive a serious complaint against you which we believe to be genuine (for example, if we receive a complaint that you are using the Services in any of the ways prohibited in Section 6). If this happens, then we will deal with the complaint in the manner set out in Section 6;<br> (g) we are required to suspend your Services as a result of an emergency or requested to do so by the emergency services, government authorities, law enforcement authorities or competent regulatory bodies; <br> (h) your use of the services exceeds that which is expected or reasonable in accordance with our Acceptable Use Policy;<br> (i) your use of the services may impact the operation of the Service Provider or Network Provider's underlying network or interferes with the provision of the Services to other customers using the Service Provider's or Network Provider's service; <br> (j) you reach or exceed a credit limit that we set on your account;<br> (k) our call volumes are likely to have an adverse effect on the operation of the Network Provider's network or the provision of services to our Network Provider's customers in general;<br> (l) our Network Provider suspends or has the right to suspend its own customers' access to its mobile network; or<br> (m) our Network Provider or Service Provider suspends our services where they are permitted to do so under our contract with the Service Provider or at law.<br>‍<br>4.20 If we Suspend any or all of your Services, you will still be able to make emergency calls (unless these have also been Suspended at the request of the emergency services or law enforcement authorities or by our Network Provider or Service Provider).<br>‍<br>4.21 Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 4.19 and 4.20 where possible we will use reasonable endeavours to inform you prior to us suspending the provision of the Services to you in circumstances where we are legally permitted to do so. When the Service is suspended you will be required to continue to pay the Plan Charge for the remainder of the Minimum Term and any other charges that you may have incurred prior to the Suspension.Security of the Services4.22 Our Service Provider and Network Provider are responsible for ensuring that appropriate technical and organisational measures are put in place to manage any risks to the security of the network over which the Services are provided to you in the UK and to prevent and/or minimise the impact of any security incidents on recipients of the Services.
