                <h2>2 LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA COLLECTION</h2>
                <p><strong>2.1 Types of data / Privacy policy scope</strong><br>‍<strong>“Personal Data”</strong> means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).<br>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of Personal Data about you which we have grouped together below. Not all of the following types of data will necessarily be collected from you but this is the full scope of data that we collect and when we collect it from you:<br>• Profile/Identity Data: This is data relating to your first name, last name, gender, date of birth.<br>• Contact Data: This is data relating to your phone number, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers.<br>• Marketing and Communications Data: This is your preferences in receiving marketing information and other information from us.<br>• Billing Data: This is information relating to your debit and credit card information such as the name attached to your payment details and your billing address.<br>• Transactional Data: This is information of details and records of all payments you have made for our services or products.<br><br>We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as We also collect use and share Aggregated Data such as how often users actively select a project to dedicate their contributions to.. Aggregated Data could be derived from your Personal Data but is not considered Personal Data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your Personal Data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as Personal Data which will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br><br>We may also aggregate data to enable research or analysis so that we can better understand and serve you and others. For example, we may conduct research on your demographics and usage. Although this aggregated data may be based in part on Personal Data, it does not identify you personally. We may share this type of anonymous data with others, including service providers, our affiliates, agents and current and prospective business partners.<br><br>We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.<br><br><strong>2.2 The Legal Basis for Collecting That Data<br>‍</strong>There are a number of justifiable reasons under the GDPR that allow collection and<br>processing of Personal Data. The main avenues we rely on are:<br>• “Consent”: Certain situations allow us to collect your Personal Data, such as when you tick a box that confirms you are happy to receive email newsletters from us, or ‘opt in’ to a service.<br>• “Contractual Obligations”: We may require certain information from you in order to fulfil our contractual obligations and provide you with the promised service.<br>• “Legal Compliance”: We’re required by law to collect and process certain types of data, such as fraudulent activity or other illegal actions.<br>• “Legitimate Interest”: We might need to collect certain information from you to be able to meet our legitimate interests - this covers aspects that can be reasonably expected as part of running our business, that will not have a material impact on your rights, freedom or interests. Examples could be your address, so that we know where to deliver something to, or your name, so that we have a record of who to contact moving forwards.</p>

                <h2>3 HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL DATA </h2>

From time to time we may make suggestions and recommendations to you about goods or services that may be of interest to you.<br><br><strong>3.3 Change of purpose</strong><br>We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.<br>If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.<br>Please note that we may process your Personal Data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>4 YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW YOU ARE PROTECTED BY US <br><br>4.1 Your legal rights<br></strong>Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:<br>• Right to be informed. You have a right to be informed about our purposes for processing your personal data, how long we store it for, and who it will be shared with. We have provided this information to you in this policy.<br>• Right of access. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it (also known as a &quot;data subject access request&quot;). See section 4.5 below for more details on how you can make a data subject access request.<br>• Right to rectification. You have a right to request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.<br>• Right to erasure. You have the right to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.<br>• Right to object. You can object to the processing of personal data we hold about you. This effectively allows you to stop or prevent us from processing your personal data. Note that this is not an absolute right and it only applies in certain circumstances, for example:<br>(i) Where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.<br>(ii) Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.<br>(iii) In some cases, we may continue processing your data if we can demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.<br>• Right to restrict processing. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of their personal data. Note that this is not an absolute right and it only applies in certain circumstances:<br>(i) If you want us to establish the data&#x27;s accuracy.<br>(ii) Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.<br>(iii) Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.<br>(iv) You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.<br>• Right to data portability. You have the right to request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. If you make such a request, we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.<strong><br><br>If you wish to make a request under any of these rights, please contact us at dpo@meaningfulplanet.co.uk.<br><br>4.2 Your control over Meaningful Planet Ltd’s use of your Personal Data<br></strong>You may delete your account at any time – this will remove your account page from our<br>systems and our related software.<br>‍<br>We guarantee this will delete all stored data.<br>‍<br>You can access information associated with your account by logging into your account you created with us.<br>‍<br>Your account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.<br><br>California Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to dpo@meaningfulplanet.co.uk.<strong><br><br>4.3 How Meaningful Planet Ltd protects customers&#x27; Personal Data<br></strong>We are concerned with keeping your data secure and protecting it from inappropriate disclosure. Any Personal Data collected by us is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems and are bound by obligations of confidentiality. If and when we use subcontractors to store your data, we will not relinquish control of your Personal Data or expose it to security risks that would not have arisen had the data remained in our possession. However, unfortunately no transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Meaningful Planet Ltd to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Data you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please contact us.<strong><br><br>4.4 Opting out of marketing promotions<br></strong>You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time via your customer account on the Meaningful Planet app.<br>‍<br>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, we will continue to retain other Personal Data provided to us as a result of interactions with us not related to your marketing preferences.<strong><br><br>4.5 How to request your data and the process for obtaining it<br></strong>You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, if your request is clearly unfounded, we could refuse to comply with your request.<br>‍<br>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure you have the right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
