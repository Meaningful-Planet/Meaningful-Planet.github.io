# Branded Open Graph Images

## How to Use

1. **Open the HTML file** in a web browser
2. **Take a screenshot** at 1200×630 pixels
3. **Save as PNG/JPG** and upload to your server
4. **Update the meta tags** in your HTML files to point to the image

## Available Images

## Brand Colors Used

- Primary: `#063412` (dark green)

- Text: White with shadows for readability

## Customization

You can modify the HTML files to:
- Change colors
- Update text content
- Add your actual logo
- Modify the layout

## Performance Note

These HTML files are lightweight and can be served directly from your server. However, for production use, consider:
- Converting to static images (PNG/JPG)
- Optimizing file sizes
- Using a CDN for faster delivery

## Next Steps

1. Open each HTML file in a browser
2. Take screenshots at 1200×630
3. Upload to your server
4. Update the meta tags in your HTML files to point to the actual image files instead of the HTML files
