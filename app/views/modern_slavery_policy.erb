      <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
            <p>At Meaningful Planet, we're committed to conducting our business ethically, transparently, and with respect for fundamental human rights. We recognise that modern slavery—encompassing forced labour, servitude, human trafficking, and exploitation—remains a serious global issue, and we take our responsibility to prevent such practices within our business and supply chains seriously.</p>
      <p>As a purpose-driven mobile network dedicated to restoring nature and protecting wildlife across the UK, our ethical principles extend beyond environmental action to include how we treat people throughout our operations. We believe that building a better world means ensuring dignity, fairness, and freedom for all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Our Business Structure</h2>
      <p>Meaningful Planet is a UK-based ethical mobile service provider that integrates environmental action into everyday essential services. Founded in 2023 we offer mobile, broadband, and other consumer services while dedicating 10% of our revenue to support nature restoration projects across the UK.</p>
      <p>Our operations are primarily based in the United Kingdom, and we work with selected partners and suppliers who share our commitment to ethical practices.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Our Policies on Modern Slavery</h2>
      <p>We have zero tolerance for any form of modern slavery. Our approach includes:</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Rigorous assessment of our supply chains and business partnerships</li>
        <li>Comprehensive checks on all employees, recruitment agencies and suppliers</li>
        <li>Fair and transparent employment practices, including legally compliant contracts, pay, and working conditions</li>
        <li>Regular policy reviews to ensure ongoing compliance and best practice</li>
        <li>Clear whistleblowing procedures for reporting concerns</li>
      </ul>
            <p>We're committed to acting with integrity in all our business relationships and implementing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery does not occur anywhere in our supply chains.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Due Diligence Processes</h2>
      <p>To identify and mitigate risk, we:</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Conduct appropriate background checks on all employees, recruitment agencies, and suppliers</li>
        <li>Provide every employee with a written employment contract and ensure they are paid in accordance with the law</li>
        <li>Comply with our legal obligations regarding working hours, rest breaks, and holidays</li>
        <li>Require suppliers to confirm their compliance with modern slavery legislation and their commitment to preventing it in their operations</li>
        <li>Maintain open communication channels for reporting concerns</li>
      </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Risk Assessment and Management</h2>
      <p>We regularly assess where the greatest risks of modern slavery exist in our business and supply chains. As a service provider with primarily UK-based operations, our direct risk exposure is relatively limited. However, we recognise that risks may exist in certain areas of our supply chain, particularly in the manufacturing of telecommunications equipment.</p>
      <p>To manage these risks, we:</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Prioritise suppliers with strong ethical records and transparent practices</li>
        <li>Include anti-slavery provisions in our contracts with suppliers</li>
        <li>Regularly review our supplier relationships</li>
        <li>Stay informed about high-risk sectors and regions</li>
      </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Training and Awareness</h2>
            <p>We're committed to ensuring that all staff understand the risks of modern slavery and what to do if they have concerns. We provide:</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Comprehensive information about this statement and our policies to all employees</li>
        <li>Specific training for managers and those involved in procurement and supplier management</li>
        <li>Regular updates on modern slavery issues and best practices</li>
        <li>Clear guidance on reporting procedures</li>
      </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Measuring Effectiveness</h2>
      <p>We assess the effectiveness of our approach by:</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Monitoring reports or concerns raised about modern slavery</li>
        <li>Reviewing supplier compliance with our requirements</li>
        <li>Conducting periodic internal audits of our policies and procedures</li>
        <li>Seeking feedback from employees and suppliers</li>
      </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
      <p>As Meaningful Planet grows, we will continue to develop and strengthen our approach to preventing modern slavery. We recognise this is an ongoing process requiring vigilance and commitment.</p>
      <p>This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our modern slavery statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2024.</p>
