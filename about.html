                <p>At Meaningful Planet, we believe that collective action can bring about monumental change.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to empower individuals and businesses to make a tangible, positive impact on the environment through their everyday essential services.</p>

                <h4>Our Story</h4>
                <p>Founded by eco-conscious entrepreneurs Nick Falkowski and Richard West, Meaningful Planet was born out of a shared passion for protecting nature and empowering others to do the same. With backgrounds in tech, product development, business telecoms,and a shared passion for the natural world, they set out to create a new kind of company - one that turns everyday telecoms services into drivers of positive change and climate impact.</p>

                        <h4>Why We Started</h4>
                        <p>In a world where many feel powerless about environmental challenges, we saw an opportunity for change. We believed that by reimagining telecoms services to have positive impact at their core, we could create a way for people and businesses to make a meaningful impact without extra effort or cost.</p>
                        <p>It started with a simple question: what if every phone call could help restore nature?</p>
